This module manages various aspects of the Debian system. If you want all
functionality at once, simply include the debian class in your manifest.

debian::rcs

The module exposes a variable for each of the known /etc/default/rcS settings,
so please check rcS(5). For instance, the TMPTIME variable can be set with
$debian_rcs_tmptime (note the capitalisation). The following variables are
currently implemented like this [with defaults]:

  TMPTIME       [7]
  SULOGIN       [false]
  DELAYLOGIN    [true]
  UTC           [true]
  VERBOSE       [false]
  FSCKFIX       [false]
  RAMRUN        [false]
  RAMLOCK       [false]
  ASYNCMOUNTNFS [false]
