functionality at once, simply include the debian class in your manifest.

This class allows for easy management of the /etc/motd file, using the Debian
Way to do so.

There are four variables you can set on a per-host bases:

$greeting_before_fqdn ["Welcome to "]
  The initial greeting, which is followed by the host's FQDN.

$lead [some warning about authorization]
  The lead message, designed to provide a space for a common introductory

  An array of paragraphs to be printed after the lead.

$newsitems []
  An array of bullet points printed with special formatting to attract
  attention.

This class exposes a variable for each of the known /etc/default/rcS settings,
