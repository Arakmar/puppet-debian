This module manages the settings in Debian's /etc/default/rcS file.

Classes and definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main class is 'rcS' and is designed for all clients.

You may want to use the rcS_setting definition to add your own settings, like
so:

  rcS_setting { ASYNCMOUNTNFS: value => false }

Variables
~~~~~~~~~
The module exposes a variable for each of the known rcS settings, so please
check rcS(5). For instance, the TMPTIME variable can be set with
$debian_rcS_tmptime (note the capitalisation). The following variables are
currently implemented like this [with defaults]:

  TMPTIME       [7]
  SULOGIN       [true]
  DELAYLOGIN    [true]
  UTC           [true]
  VERBOSE       [false]
  FSCKFIX       [true]
  RAMRUN        [true]
  RAMLOCK       [true]
  ASYNCMOUNTNFS [false]
